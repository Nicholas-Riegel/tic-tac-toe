# tic-tac-toe

I start with a simple game in the 'script.js' file. Then I add other js files, making the game increasingly complex and incorporating more modules and objects per the TOP instructions.

script.js // simple game <br>
script2.js // game with scorekeeper <br>
script3.js // placing functions in a module <br>

I did not find placing the functions inside a module helpful in this case. Instead, it just seemed to increase the complexity of the code. But I can see how it might be helpful in larger, more complex projects. 

Frankly, I can't see following the TOP instuctions anymore than I have at this point. Using factory functions for the player data is needlessly complex, since there is so little player data. Likewise, for using an array for the boardgame. Perhaps I will revisit this project at a later date. But right now, I can't see the value in continuing to incorporate these structures.
